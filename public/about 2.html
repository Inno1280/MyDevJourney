<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
<p>
  Greetings, My name is Innocent Nweke, an enthusiastic mid-level UX designer and full-stack web developer. 
  With a strong creative streak and the ability to transform concepts into digital products that puts the user front and center. Here is my story:</p>

  
<p> 
  
  <u><b>Design Philosophy</b></u>

</p>

  <p>
  In the area of design, I firmly uphold the principle that 
  function should guide form. My approach to UX Design centers on an 
  extended understanding of User requirements and behavior. 
  I am committed to creating product interfaces that are 
  first and foremost User-centric, posses good aesthetics 
  and also prioritize ease of use. My design process is well 
  established on the Ux Design Framework: involving thorough 
  research, accurate wireframing, and continuous User-Testing 
  to ensure that the final outcome exceeds the desired
   expectations.</p>

  <p>
    <u><b>Development Proficiency</b></u>
  </p>

As a full-stack web developer, I delight the opportunity to infuse 
life into designs through the creation of clean and efficient code. 
My expertise in front-end technologies such as <I><B>HTML, CSS, and 
JavaScript</I></B> enables me to build responsive and visually captivating 
websites. On the back end side of things, I possess proficiency in 
languages like <i><b>Python, Ruby, and PHP</b></i>, empowering me to build robust 
and scalable web applications. I flourish on tackling challenges 
and am endlessly exploring innovative technologies to remain at the 
forefront of web development trends.

As the Tech industry is constantly changing, I am dedicated to 
keeping tabs on the latest trends. I stay informed by attending 
conferences and engaging in ongoing education to ensure that my

design and development.
